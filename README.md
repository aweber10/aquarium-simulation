# Aquarium Web Migration

This repository will host the modern JavaScript-based rewrite of the legacy Aquarium Java applet.

## Development Setup

- Reference the legacy sources under `../aquarium` in read-only mode as described in `../aquarium-migration-plan.md`.
- Build new functionality and assets inside this project.

## Next Steps

- Scaffold the core application structure (bundler, build tooling, etc.).
- Port features incrementally from the legacy applet while adding automated tests.
